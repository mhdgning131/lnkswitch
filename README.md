# LNK target spoofing generator
---

This script generate Windows Short with a fake displayed target, but launch a different file on click !

1. The Specified displayed decoy and the real executed target must exist on the system
2. The LNK icon depend on the specified decoy file type

Actually Icon auto changing system doesn't work (tested on 11 25H2) Explorer fail to manage icon indexes in Shell32 or imageres. No idea how to come through
If you can contribute that would be a lot ❤️
